# Parks-and-Rec

For this project I wanted to examine the attendance numbers for all of New York State parks. The data was acquired at Data.ny.gov (https://data.ny.gov/Recreation/State-Park-Annual-Attendance-Figures-by-Facility-B/8f3n-xj78). The data contains 5 columns which includes; the region, the county, facility (name of park), attendance number, and the year for that is from. 
I have 4 main questions to be answered through the data. My first question is which park has the most total visitors? My second question is what was the least popular park in 2020? My third question is which park has the most decrease in visitors in the last 4 years. My final question is which park had the most average yearly visitors.
To begin this analysis, I decided to exclude all year data up to 2018. This is because I only wanted to see the last 4 years of data for this project, but may return later to do all. There were some issues with the data as there was separate entries for each year, even if itâ€™s the same park. As a result, I moved the attendance numbers into the column with its respected park and separated by year. I also calculated the change in attendance from 2018-2021 and created a column for that. All of this was done in excel.
This was then imported into SQL as shown in this repository. From there I created my views to be uploaded to tableau for visualization as shown in this repository.
